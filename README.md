# bitcoin-rich-list
A randomly generated Bitcoin Rich List based on various DOM Array methods

## Motivation

Rather than focusing on the design of the web app, this little project was created to test my knowledge of DOM Array Methods, using the Fetch API and manipiulating JSON objects

## Tech used
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks were harmed in the making of this project.

This also uses the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) which is pretty awesome. It occasionally throws up some Arabic-looking names too, in case you're wondering where those are coming from. If you'd like to remove those, you should be able to do so with a regular expression on the names.

## Features
The app allows you to filter to Bitcoin billionaires only, convert to US Dollars (using a fixed conversion rate set at the date the web app was created), sort by wealth in both descending and ascending order and calculate the total wealth of all of the "traders" in the Rich List.

## Credits
I got inspired to build this after seeing [Brad Traversy's DOM Array Methods Project from his Vanilla Web Projects](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/dom-array-methods), so I've been heavily influenced by that.

I looked at his code, recreated it exactly, wrote down the project specifications, and then created this mini web app from scratch based solely on those project specifications without looking at Brad's code. Any similarities are purely coincidental.

Naturally, it should be fairly obvious to say that I've been influenced by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/) although their Rich List actually has real people in it and looks a lot better than mine!
